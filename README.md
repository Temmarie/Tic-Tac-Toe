# Tic-Tac-Toe Project
We built a tic-tac-toe game on the command line where two human players can play against each other and the board is displayed in between turns.
It was made as a collaborative project in Ruby using OOP concepts.

# What it does
The game collects input from the users and replaces the board positions based on the user inputs with their individual characters.
To win the game, a player has to have 3 of their characters in a row (vertically, horizontally or diagonally).

# Live demo

# Built With
Ruby

# Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

Clone the project unto your local machine cd to the folder and run `bin/main.rb` on your terminal

# Instructions to Play
- The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.

- Input your name by pressing "P" or join as a guest by pressing "Enter"

- Player1's character is "X" and Player2's character is "O"

- Players take turns putting their characters in empty squares.

- The first player to get 3 of their characters in a row (vertically, horizontally or diagonally) is the winner.

- When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 characters in a row, the game ends in a tie.

- You can restart the game if you wish to!
